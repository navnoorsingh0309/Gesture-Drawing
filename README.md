# Gesture-Drawing

This script allows you to draw on a live webcam screen using hand gestures, with the option to select different colors. It's a versatile tool that can be used in various real-life scenarios where you need to mark or inspect images, not necessarily on life camera.

## Libraries Used

I have used numpy, opencv-python and mediapipe library for this project.
